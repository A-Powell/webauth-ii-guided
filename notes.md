# Auth Notes
- It's about the *client* (software) connecting to the API, it's NOT about the user that is logged in.
    - to the server, the same user on the same computer connected from Insomnia/Postman is different from the same user connected from the browser.
- the server has amnesia, it will NOT remember the client across requests.
    - http is stateless, there is no common data shared between client and server.
- we need a way to help the server "remember" the client across requests. 🍪
## Cookies 🍪
- a cookie is a container of data
- a browser will automatically send cookies on every request to the domain associated with the cookie
- the client will store the cookie in a special place (NOT called a Cookie Jar 🤣)
A server can send a _header_ (Set-Cookie) suggesting to the client that it stores a _cookie_.
The client sends the cookies in a _Cookie_ header back to the server.
## Sessions
- like a database
- used to store data on the server, much like a database.
